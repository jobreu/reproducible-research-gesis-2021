In this set of exercises, we will 1) make sure that you can use `Git` from within *RStudio* and 2) clone and work on the *GitHub* repository you have created in the previous session.

*Note*: You can find the solutions for this exercise as well as the following ones in the `solutions` folder within the workshop materials.

```{block, box.title = "1", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
If you have not already done so, the first thing you should do is check whether *RStudio* can detect `Git`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The easiest way to do this in *RStudio* is via the Global Options.
```

```{block, solution = TRUE}
You can check whether *RStudio* can detect your local `Git` installation via *Tools* -> *Global Options* -> *Git/SVN*. If the menu displays the location of a `Git` executable, everything should work. If this is not the case, you may need to point *RStudio* to the location of your `Git` executable. You can find some further information on this in the troubleshooting section [*RStudio, Git, GitHub Hell*](https://happygitwithr.com/troubleshooting.html) of [*Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html).
```

```{block, box.title = "2", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
You may also have done this already, but in case not, now is the time to set up a *GitHub* personal access token (PAT) for use with `R` and *RStudio*.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
There are two ways of doing this: Through the *GitHub* web interface or via a command from an `R` package.
```

```{r create-pat, solution = TRUE, eval = F}
# Option 1: While logged in to your GitHub account go to https://github.com/settings/tokens,
# click "Generate token", and select "gist", "repo", "user", and "workflow" as scopes.

# Option 2
library(usethis)

create_github_token()
```

```{block, box.title = "3", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Next, we want to store the PAT for future use with `R`/*RStudio*.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
The [`gitcreds` package](https://gitcreds.r-lib.org/) (which should be installed together with [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/)) provides a function for this.
```

```{r store-pat, solution = TRUE, eval = F}
library(gitcreds)

gitcreds_set()
```

```{block, box.title = "4", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
After we've made sure that we can use `Git` via *RStudio* and have created and stored a PAT for authentication via `HTTPS`, we can now clone and work on the `GitHub` repository we have created in the previous session. When doing this, you should also create a new *RStudio* project.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can create a new version-controlled project that is connected to an existing *GitHub* repository via the *RStudio* menu. If you need some further information, you can check out the [New project, GitHub first](https://happygitwithr.com/new-github-first.html) section in *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR*.
```

```{block, solution = TRUE}
You can create a new version-controlled project and associate it with a repository cloned from *GitHub* via *File* -> *New Project* -> *Version Control*. Then choose `Git`, enter the URL of the *GitHub* repository (remember that we want to use `HTTPS` for authentication; if you want to use `SSH`, you need to provide a different URL), and choose a location where to store the project on your local machine. 
As we will start working on the project right away, also check "Open in new session".
```

```{block, box.title = "5", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
If everything has worked, a new instance of *RStudio* should have opened with the working directory set to the location of your new project, the files included in the project folder visible in the *Files* tab, and an active `Git` tab. To make extra sure that everything worked, let's check the `Git` status of our project via the `Terminal` in *RStudio*.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You may want to check which shell the `Terminal` in *RStudio* uses via *Tools* -> *Global Options* -> *Terminal*. If you use Windows, you should choose `Git Bash` (which you should have installed with `Git` for Windows).
```

```{bash, solution = TRUE, eval=FALSE}
git status
```

```{block, box.title = "6", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
Now that the project is set up and in sync with the remote *GitHub* repository, we can start working on it. Modify the README file (just add, remove or edit a few words). If you want to, you can also create a new folder called `data` and copy the file `ZA5667_v1-0-0_CSV_synthetic-data.csv` from the workshop materials there (either via the CLI/Terminal or by copying and pasting in your file explorer). This second step is optional. We will be using this in the following sessions, but you can also copy it then.

After modifying the file(s), save the changes (via the *Save* icon in the *RStudio* menu or the keyboard shortcut your OS uses for saving files) and stage them in `Git`.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can use the *RStudio* GUI for staging changes (for modified or added files). As a reminder: When you modify existing files and/or create new ones and save the changes, these should be displayed in the `Git` tab in *RStudio* and their status will be indicated as *modified* or *untracked*.
```

```{block, solution = TRUE}
You can stage changed files in the *RStudio*  GUI by checking the boxes in the *Staged* column in the `Git` tab.
```

```{block, box.title = "7", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
After staging your changes, let's create a commit and push that to the remote *GitHub* repository.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
You can do both (committing and pushing) via the *RStudio* GUI. Remember to write a meaningful commit message before you push.
```

```{block, solution = TRUE}
After staging the changes, simply click on the *Commit* button in the `Git` tab in *RStudio*, write a commit message in the menu that opens up, and then click the *Push*  button in the same menu.
```

```{block, box.title = "8", box.body = list(fill = "white"), box.icon = "fa-star"}
As a final exercise for this session, let's do the opposite of pushing and pull changes from *GitHub* to your local project. Before we can do this, we first need to make some edits in the remote repository. For that purpose, go to the website of your *GitHub* repository (while being logged in) and edit the README file in the browser (again, just add, remove, or edit a few words). You can do that via the small pen icon next displayed above the content of your README file. Once you have done that, you can pull the changes to your local project.
```

```{block, opts.label = "clues"}
If you edit a file via the *GitHub* page, you also need to make a commit (and add a commit message) through that interface. You can do the pull operation via the respective icon in the *RStudio* GUI.
```

```{block, solution = TRUE}
After making and saving the edits to the README file via the *GitHub* page for your repository, you can simply click the *Pull* button in the `Git` tab in *RStudio* to update your local project.
```
