    "\n",
    "- `data`: the original raw data, you shouldn’t edit or otherwise alter any of the files in this folder. DATA ARE READ ONLY. If they are encoded in a supported file format, they’ll automatically be loaded when you call load.project().\n",
    "\n",
    "- `cache`: Here is where you will store any data sets that (a) are generated during a preprocessing step and (b) don’t need to be regenerated every single time you analyze your data. You can use the cache() function to store data to this directory automatically. Any data set found in both the cache and data directories will be drawn from cache instead of data based on ProjectTemplate’s priority rules. We write them to .csv files (comma eperated values) so they are machine readable and can be easily shared.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `graphs`: the folder where we can store the figures used in the project In our example, the figures are generated directly during the rendering of the RMardown file for the manuscript, but having the figures as standalone files may facilitate getting feedback from your collaborators, or save time if you just work on tweaking its appearance without having to recompile the full manuscript.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `src`: our R code (the functions that will generate the intermediate datasets, the analyses, and the figures), it’s often easier to keep the prose separated from the code. If you have a lot of code (and/or if the manuscript is long), it’s easier to navigate.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `tests`: the code to test that our functions are behaving properly and that all our data is included in the analysis.\n",
    "There are other directories that you may not need as a newcomer, but these will come on handy as you increase your knowledge and prowess with R.\n",
