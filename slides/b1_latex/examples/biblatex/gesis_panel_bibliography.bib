We found that prevalence is in the range 2.8–4.3 percent within the single survey waves. However, the share of panelists who at least occasionally use mobile devices across the eight waves considered is higher (about 8. No significant determinants were found for the use of mobile devices, despite the well-known age effect (larger mobile usage propensity for younger compared to older panelists). Finally, we replicate previous findings on the risk of dropping out being associated with the use of smartphones but not with the use of tablets.},

	abstract = {The vast amount of meat consumed in the Western world is critically discussed with regard to negative health consequences, environmental impact, and ethical concerns for animals, emphasizing the need to extend knowledge regarding the correlates of meat consumption in the general population. In the present article, we conducted two studies examining the associations between meat consumption and personality traits, political attitudes, and environmental attitudes in two large German representative samples (Ntotal = 8,879, aged 18–96 years). Cross-sectional data on frequency of meat consumption, socio-demographics, personality traits, and political and environmental attitudes were collected via self-reports. In both studies, male sex, younger age, and lower educational attainment were significantly positively related to meat consumption. In Study 1, results of the partial correlations and the hierarchical regression analysis controlling for socio-demographics showed that the personality traits of openness and agreeableness, as well as conservative political and social views, explained unique variance in meat consumption. In Study 2, partial correlations and hierarchical regression analyses showed that openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were all uniquely negatively related to meat consumption. Moreover, these analyses documented that people scoring high in right-wing attitudes and low in pro-environmental attitudes reported more overall meat consumption. Taken together, these two studies provided evidence that socio-demographics, personality traits, and attitudes are indeed related to how much meat is consumed. Implications and future prospects for the study of individual differences in meat consumption are discussed.},

Most of those that do exist share three common characteristics: openness in terms of being accessible for academic researchers from any substantive area to field primary studies and to use the data collected, probability-based sampling and therefore optimized for yielding unbiased population estimates in the respective countries, and transparency in terms of the processes by which these infrastructures have been built and are being operated.},

	doi = {10.12758/mda.2015.001},
	abstract = {One of the methods for evaluating online panels in terms of data quality is comparing the estimates that the panels provide with benchmark sources. For probability-based online panels, high-quality surveys or government statistics can be used as references. If differences among the benchmark and the online panel estimates are found, these can have several causes. First, the question wordings can differ between the sources, which can lead to differences in measurement. Second, the reference and the online panel may not be comparable in terms of sample composition. Finally, since the reference estimates are usually collected face-to-face or by telephone, mode effects might be expected. In this article, we investigate mode system effects, an alternative to mode effects that does not focus solely on measurement differences between the modes, but also incorporates survey design features into the comparison. The data from a probability-based offline-recruited online panel is compared to the data from two face-to-face surveys with almost identical recruitment protocols. In the analysis, the distinction is made between factual and attitudinal questions. We report both effect sizes of the differences and significances. The results show that the online panel differs from face-to-face surveys in both attitudinal and factual measures. However, the reference surveys only differ in attitudinal measures and show no significant differences for factual questions. We attribute this to the instability of attitudes and thus show the importance of triangulation and using two surveys of the same mode for comparison.},

But so far, little research has been conducted to analyse the relations between citizens’ respective preferences and their political behaviour. To address this void in the literature, our article investigates the extent to which citizens’ preferences for certain political decision-makers (politicians, citizens or expert) have an impact on their retrospective and prospective political participation. Our analysis draws on data from a survey conducted in autumn of 2014 on a probability representative sample in Germany. Results indicate that respondents favouring politicians as decision-makers focus mainly on voting. Those who favour citizens as decision-makers are more willing to get involved in participatory procedures, while those inclined towards expert decision-making show mixed participation.},

	url = {https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/301751},
	shorttitle = {Data quality in probability-based online panels},
	abstract = {Online panels – surveys administered over the Internet in which persons are asked to complete surveys regularly – offer cost reductions compared to surveys that use more traditional modes of data collection (face-to-face, telephone, and mail). However, some characteristics of online panels may cause errors, threatening the data quality. For example, excluding non-Internet users may result in coverage error; if persons selected for the study cannot be reached or do not want to participate, it may result in nonresponse error; study participants may choose to stop participating in later waves (attrition). Furthermore, respondents may learn to answer dishonestly or answer filter questions negatively to reduce the burden of participation. The main question of this dissertation is that of how good is the data collected in probability-based online panels (i.e., panels in which respondents are selected by researchers as a result of application of statistical procedures of random sampling). The five studies in this dissertation address the questions of data quality, using data from a probability-based telephone-recruited online panel of Internet users in Germany. To answer the question about goodness of the final estimates collected in the online panel, we compared data from the online panel to data from two high-quality face-to-face reference surveys. We found several differences among the surveys, however, most of these differences averaged to a few percentage points. We took the analysis further studying mode system effects (i.e., differences in the estimates as the results of the whole process by which they were collected). We found that the online panel and further two reference surveys differed in attitudinal measures. However, for factual questions the reference surveys differed from the online panel and not from each other. Our overall conclusion is that the data from the online panel is fairly comparable to the data from high-quality face-to-face surveys. This dissertation concentrated on the processes that can cause errors in data collected in the online panel. We found that participation in the panel is selective: previous experience with the Internet and online surveys predicted willingness to participate and actual participation in the panel. Incentives and fieldwork agencies that performed the recruitment also influenced the decision to participate. To study why panel members chose to discontinue participation, we contrasted the role of incentives and non-reward motivation. We found that respondents who viewed surveys as long, difficult, too personal were more likely to attrite and that incentives (although negatively related to attrition) did not compensate for this burdensome experience. To find out if the group of respondents who are longer in the panel would answer differently than the group of respondents with a shorter duration, we conducted two experiments. We found limited evidence of advantageous learning and no evidence of disadvantageous learning. The results of this dissertation provide additional insight into the processes that contribute to the quality of data produced by probability-based online panels. These results can guide researchers who plan to build online panels and might prove useful for existing panels that consider switching to the online mode.},

	abstract = {Online surveys are one of the most prominent data collection methods in Europe and the {USA}. Not only are they fast and cheap, data quality in well-designed online surveys is high, especially when sensitive questions are asked. Disadvantages are the threat of undercoverage, as not everyone has Internet access, and high nonresponse. In order to overcome these disadvantages, mixed-mode designs are used in which multiple data collection methods are combined. The strength of mixed-mode surveys is their potential to reduce coverage and nonresponse error at affordable costs. However, survey modes may differ in the effect they have on measurement error, and one critical question is how data from different modes may be combined. A special form of mixed mode design is a mixed-device survey. Web surveys are increasingly completed on a range of different devices. Mobile phones, tablets, and even smart watches are being used in addition to regular desktop {PCs}. The question arises whether or not answers obtained via smartphones or tablets are comparable to answers via regular desktop {PCs}. Screen sizes are very different and also the mode of response entry varies between devices. Survey software increasingly adapts to mobile survey responding via responsive survey design. The software detects the device used for completing the survey and adapts the format accordingly. This chapter discusses the most common designs for mixed mode surveys and summarizes the empirical evidence for reducing coverage and nonresponse error and then focuses on measurement error. We pay special attention to careful design and provide rules for doing web surveys that are in fact mixed-device surveys.},

Our empirical analysis shows that such populist conceptions of democracy are particularly strong among {AfD} supporters. Moreover, they exhibit significant and substantial effects on voting intentions for the {AfD} in multivariate analyses and, leveraging the panel structure of the data, are able to predict changes in party preferences towards the {AfD} over time.},

This article explores whether two question order effects (one due to the norm of evenhandedness and the other due to subtraction or perceptual contrast) appear in surveys of probability samples in the United States and 11 other countries (Canada, Denmark, Germany, Iceland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom; N = 25,640). Advancing theory of question order effects, we propose necessary conditions for each effect to occur, and found that the effects occurred in the nations where these necessary conditions were met. Surprisingly, the abortion question order effect even appeared in some countries in which the necessary condition was not met, suggesting that the question order effect there (and perhaps elsewhere) was not due to subtraction or perceptual contrast. The question order effects were not moderated by education. The strength of the effect due to the norm of evenhandedness was correlated with various cultural characteristics of the nations. Strong support was observed for the form-resistant correlation hypothesis.},

Dazu verwenden wir Daten aus zwei Wellen des {GESIS} Panels. Mit Hilfe von Mehrebenenanalysen lassen sich zwar empirische Nachweise für beide Erklärungsansätze finden, für die Vorhersagen beider Theorien finden wir jedoch in Abhängigkeit der situativen Rahmung der Entscheidung auch teilweise inkonsistente Ergebnisse.},

	abstract = {This paper deals with social acceptance of applying the equity principle for intra-familial time transfers. Based on a representative survey among German citizens, the author provides empirical evidence on acceptance of financial compensation for different time transfers. Some 80\% of the subjects stated that intra-familial long-term care should be compensated. At the same time, only 38\% of subjects stated that grandparental childcare should be compensated: The majority accepts equity principle for intra-familial long-term care but not for grandparental childcare. Age has the strongest effect: subjects belonging to the old generation are more likely to accept the equity principle for informal long-term care as well as for grandparental childcare. Family valuation does not matter in any of the dimensions. It is puzzling that being a female by itself does not explain the differences in social acceptance even though females are much more actively involved in all types of time transfers.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=3202162},
	abstract = {Studies about Islamist inspired terror attacks in Europe identified a recently declining impact among a broader audience and suggest that terrorism has been “normalized”. How does normalization work? I argue that it can work through information and emotion. Informational normalization occurs when audiences expect an attack, hence changes in attitudes become unnecessary. Emotional normalization occurs when audiences lose sensitivity to attacks, tempering emotional arousal. To assess these claims, I analyze a panel survey conducted around the Berlin Christmas Market attack in 2016 and account for baseline information, an approach not used before. I find that attitudes like trust in government, national identification and views of Islam remain unchanged. Sadness, fear and anger are heightened for up to three days after the attack. The German audience may thus have expected an attack, but still be sensitive to it.},

	abstract = {Despite being part of the original concept in “The American Voter”, multiple party identifications ({MPID}) have rarely been analyzed. Based on a 2016 survey that is representative of the German electorate, we investigate the determinants of multiple party attachments in Germany. With the help of a new measurement instrument for {MPID}, we can show that multiple attachments are a common phenomenon in Germany: Nearly 30\% of the respondents and more than half of all party adherents identify themselves with more than one party. Political interest and education as facets of political involvement have a significant effect on the likelihood of holding multiple attachments within ideological camps. Cross-pressures lead to a higher probability of having multiple identifications between political camps.},
