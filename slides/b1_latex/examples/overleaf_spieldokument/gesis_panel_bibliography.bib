Das Buch stellt damit eine Reaktion auf die zeitgenössische und provokante These einer Politologin und eines Politologen aus den Vereinigten Staaten dar. John R. Hibbing und Elizabeth Theiss-Morse behaupten in ihrer populären Studie Stealth Democracy, dass viele Menschen nur minimale politische Beteiligungsrechte einfordern würden und generell nichts mit Politik zu tun haben möchten. Die Autorin überträgt dieses Konzept auf die Schweiz und somit auf ein Land, das sich durch weitreichende politische Mitbestimmungsrechte auszeichnet. Die empirischen Untersuchungen weisen darauf hin, dass die Schweizerinnen und Schweizer mit den vorherrschenden direktdemokratischen Institutionen und Strukturen mehrheitlich zufrieden sind und eine Stealth Democracy tendenziell eher ablehnen.},

  abstract = {With the election of Donald Trump and landmark wins for populists across Europe, one of today's most pressing questions is: why do people support populists? We theorize that citizens who score low on the personality trait Agreeableness -- those who are more distrusting, cynical and tough-minded -- are more susceptible to anti-establishment messages expressed by populists. Using thirteen population-based cross-sectional samples collected in eight countries and three continents, we first show that individuals who score low on Agreeableness are more likely to support populists. Moreover, with a conjoint experiment, we demonstrate that it is their anti-establishment message, which makes populists attractive to people who score low on Agreeableness. As such, this paper outlines a broader theoretical framework that links personality to political persuasion. In a time when politicians tailor their messages to the psychological make-up of their voters, it is crucial to understand the interplay between political communication and personality.},

  abstract = {For decades, migration to Germany has been a relevant social phenomenon resulting in an increasing share of foreigners and Germans with migration background in the German populace. Additionally, since 2015, Germany has experienced a substantial increase in the immigration of people seeking refuge and asylum from civil war, economic and environmental catastrophes, and other adverse living conditions. These developments can be assumed to have led to an increase in intergroup contact between Germans and foreigners. We investigate this phenomenon in a multifaceted fashion by combining a social indicator and monitoring approach using repeated cross-sections over time with a new panel approach using a short-time panel to study causal relations. As a first step, we descriptively analyze the development of intergroup contact experiences of the German population with foreigners in various areas of life using data from the ALLBUS survey collected over 36 years between 1980 and 2016. Specifically, we detail the diverging contact experiences of participants with and without migration background as well as participants in the former Eastern and Western part of Germany. In a second step, based on Allport’s intergroup contact theory that contact with outgroup members may improve attitudes towards these outgroups and other related findings, we examine the longitudinal processes between positive intergroup contact with foreigners and attitudes towards foreigners using four waves of the GESIS Panel collected over approximately one and a half years. We apply special rigor to these analyses by differentiating stable differences in intergroup contact experiences and attitudes between participants from within-person processes and discussing the implications of this differentiation.},

  abstract = {The large gap in political participation between well-educated and wealthy citizens on the one hand and less educated and poorer citizens, on the other hand, has in recent years gained new attention. Several authors argue that unequal participation leads to unequal political representation and responsiveness and results in policy decisions that are tilted against the interests of disadvantaged groups, thus further increasing inequality. This paper takes a different starting point by turning the old question why people do not participate in politics around and asking why people participate. We hypothesize that enduring engagement with politics requires individuals to be resilient in the face of frustration and to possess strong, perhaps even delusional, efficacy beliefs. Using data from the German GESIS Panel we demonstrate positive correlations between individual resilience, internal and external efficacy, and political participation. We conclude by pointing to the possibility that resilience and efficacy beliefs help privileged groups to overcome collective action problems to achieve disproportionate influence on political decisions and point to avenues for further research.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a growing number of studies investigating the accuracy of nonprobability online panels; however, response quality in nonprobability online panels has not yet received much attention. To fill this gap, we investigate response quality in a comprehensive study of seven nonprobability online panels and three probability-based online panels with identical fieldwork periods and questionnaires in Germany. Three response quality indicators typically associated with survey satisficing are assessed: straight-lining in grid questions, item nonresponse, and midpoint selection in visual design experiments. Our results show that there is significantly more straight-lining in the nonprobability online panels than in the probability-based online panels. However, contrary to our expectations, there is no generalizable difference between nonprobability online panels and probability-based online panels with respect to item nonresponse. Finally, neither respondents in nonprobability online panels nor respondents in probability-based online panels are significantly affected by the visual design of the midpoint of the answer scale.},

  abstract = {Reluctance of respondents to participate in surveys has long drawn the attention of survey researchers. Yet, little is known about what drives a respondent’s decision to answer the survey invitation early or late during the field period. Moreover, we still lack evidence on response timing in longitudinal surveys. That is, the questions on whether response timing is a rather stable respondent characteristic and what—if anything—affects change in response timing across different interviews remain open. We relied on data from a mixed-mode general population panel survey collected between 2014 and 2016 to study the stability of response timing across 18 panel waves and factors that influence the decision to participate early or late in the field period. Our results suggest that the factors which had effects on response timing are different in the mail and web modes. Moreover, we found that experience with prior panel waves affected the respondent’s decision to participate early or late. Overall, the present study advocates understanding response timing as a metric variable and, consequently, the need to reflect this in modeling strategies.},

  abstract = {In this study, we investigate whether mobile device use in surveys can be predicted. We aim to identify possible motives for device use and build a model by drawing on theory from technology acceptance research and survey research. We then test this model with a Structural Equation Modeling approach using data of seven waves of the GESIS panel. We test whether our theoretical model fits the data by focusing on measures of fit, and by studying the standardized effects of the model. Results reveal that intention to use a particular device can predict actual use quite well. Ease of smartphone use is the most meaningful variable: if people use a smartphone for specific tasks, their intention to use a smartphone for survey completion is also more likely. In conclusion, investing in ease of use of mobile survey completion could encourage respondents to use mobile devices. This can foremost be established by building well-designed surveys for mobile devices.},

  abstract = {Are people’s attitudes towards referenda as a decision-making procedure driven by their material self-interest, or do individuals predominantly value direct democracy as such, regardless of the material payoffs associated with anticipated policy outcomes? To answer this question, we use a survey data set that offers information on respondents’ support for referenda as a procedure to decide on tax policy, their general views on direct democracy and redistribution, their income levels, socio-economic characteristics, and, most importantly, their expectation about the majority’s support for higher taxes. Allowing for alternative motives to welcome or oppose direct democracy, we find that income per se does not influence individuals’ procedural preferences. However, if respondents expect a clear population majority in favor of or against more redistribution their attitude towards referenda as a procedure to decide on taxation is clearly aligned with their income position.},

  abstract = {In this article, we aim to disentangle the extent to which citizens’ conceptions of democratic decision-making are shaped by populist attitudes or rather by radical left and right host ideologies. Following recent work by Landwehr and Steiner (2017), we distinguish four modes of decision-making embedded in different conceptions of democracy: trusteeship democracy, anti-pluralism, deliberative proceduralism, and majoritarianism. Drawing on data from Austria and Germany, we show that populism and radical host ideologies tap into different dimensions of democracy. While populism is primarily directed against representative forms of democratic decision-making, preferences for deliberative procedures and majority decisions appear entirely shaped by radical left and right host ideologies. Populism thus views decision-making based on the general will of the people as the only legitimate democratic procedure, whereas radical left and right host ideologies aim at involving the relevant group(s) of citizens. Further analyses of the interactions between populist attitudes and radical host ideologies confirm that the effects of populism remain robust and thus independent of the specific manifestations of radical host ideologies. These findings help to disentangle the causes of democratic discontent and to develop possible responses through democratic reforms that specifically and separately aim to mitigate populism and radical host ideologies.},

  abstract = {Nonresponse in panel studies can lead to a substantial loss in data quality due to its potential to introduce bias and distort survey estimates. Recent work investigates the usage of machine learning to predict nonresponse in advance, such that predicted nonresponse propensities can be used to inform the data collection process. However, predicting nonresponse in panel studies requires accounting for the longitudinal data structure in terms of model building, tuning, and evaluation. This study proposes a longitudinal framework for predicting nonresponse with machine learning and multiple panel waves and illustrates its application. With respect to model building, this approach utilizes information from multiple waves by introducing features that aggregate previous (non)response patterns. Concerning model tuning and evaluation, temporal cross-validation is employed by iterating through pairs of panel waves such that the training and test sets move in time. Implementing this approach with data from a German probability-based mixed-mode panel shows that aggregating information over multiple panel waves can be used to build prediction models with competitive and robust performance over all test waves.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Background:             Risk communication during pandemics is an element of paramount importance. Understanding the level of public concern implicates expensive and time-consuming surveys. We hypothesize that the relative search volume from Google Trends could be used as an indicator of public concern towards prevention measures as well as of the adequacy of the official messages spread.             Methods:             The search terms ‘             RKI             ’, ‘             corona             ’ and ‘             protective mask’             in German language were shortlisted. Cross-correlations between these terms and the reported cases from February 15             th             to April 27             th             were conducted for each German federal state. The findings were contrasted against a timeline of official communications concerning COVID-19.             Results:             The highest correlations of the term ‘             RKI’             (Robert Koch Institute, national public health authority in Germany) with reported COVID-19 cases were found between lags of -2 and -12 days, meaning web searches were already performed two to twelve days before case numbers increased. A similar pattern was seen for the term ‘             corona             ’. Cross-correlations indicated that most searches on ‘             protective mask             ’ were performed six to twelve days after the increase of cases.             Conclusions:             The results for the term ‘             protective mask             ’ indicate some degree of confusion in the population, which is supported by the contradictory recommendations on the wearing of face masks over time. In addition, the relative search volumes could be a useful tool to provide timely information on location-based risk communication strategies.},

  abstract = {The call for more direct democracy, and referenda in particular, is often heard and met with support from large numbers of citizens in many countries. This article explores the motives for supporting referenda: Do citizens support them for intrinsic reasons, because referenda allow them to exercise their democratic rights more directly? Or are preferences for referenda predominantly based on the expectation that they will produce desired policy outcomes and thus instrumentally motivated? Our survey experiment explores such instrumental preferences by assessing how substantial policy preferences affect individuals’ choice of referenda over alternative decision-making procedures. We show that congruence between a respondent’s own opinion and the expected majority opinion is associated with support for a referendum on a given matter, and thus arrive at the conclusion that calls for referenda should be reassessed in light of the partly instrumental character of procedural preferences.},

  abstract = {Online surveys are one of the most prominent data collection methods in Europe and the USA. Not only are they fast and cheap, data quality in well-designed online surveys is high, especially when sensitive questions are asked. Disadvantages are the threat of undercoverage, as not everyone has Internet access, and high nonresponse. In order to overcome these disadvantages, mixed-mode designs are used in which multiple data collection methods are combined. The strength of mixed-mode surveys is their potential to reduce coverage and nonresponse error at affordable costs. However, survey modes may differ in the effect they have on measurement error, and one critical question is how data from different modes may be combined. A special form of mixed mode design is a mixed-device survey. Web surveys are increasingly completed on a range of different devices. Mobile phones, tablets, and even smart watches are being used in addition to regular desktop PCs. The question arises whether or not answers obtained via smartphones or tablets are comparable to answers via regular desktop PCs. Screen sizes are very different and also the mode of response entry varies between devices. Survey software increasingly adapts to mobile survey responding via responsive survey design. The software detects the device used for completing the survey and adapts the format accordingly. This chapter discusses the most common designs for mixed mode surveys and summarizes the empirical evidence for reducing coverage and nonresponse error and then focuses on measurement error. We pay special attention to careful design and provide rules for doing web surveys that are in fact mixed-device surveys.},

Disadvantages are the threat of undercoverage, as not everyone has Internet access, and high nonresponse. In order to overcome these disadvantages, mixed-mode designs are used in which multiple data collection methods are combined. The strength of mixed-mode surveys is their potential to reduce coverage and nonresponse error at affordable costs. However, survey modes may differ in the effect they have on measurement error, and one critical question is how data from different modes may be combined. A special form of mixed mode design is a mixed-device survey. Web surveys are increasingly completed on a range of different devices. Mobile phones, tablets, and even smart watches are being used in addition to regular desktop PCs. The question arises whether or not answers obtained via smartphones or tablets are comparable to answers via regular desktop PCs. Screen sizes are very different and also the mode of response entry varies between devices. Survey software increasingly adapts to mobile survey responding via responsive survey design. The software detects the device used for completing the survey and adapts the format accordingly. This chapter discusses the most common designs for mixed mode surveys and summarizes the empirical evidence for reducing coverage and nonresponse error and then focuses on measurement error. We pay special attention to careful design and provide rules for doing web surveys that are in fact mixed-device surveys.},

Nach einer Operationalisierung der Parteiidentifikation auf Basis der reduzierten IDPG-Skala nach Mael und Tetrick (1992), kann auf repräsentativer Datenbasis gezeigt werden, dass sowohl die Art mehrfacher Parteibindungen, d.h. innerhalb (konvergierend) oder zwischen politischen Lagern (konfligierend)als auch die Stärkendifferenz der Bindungen, die Wahrscheinlichkeit für das Vorliegen einer Wahlintention und die Wahlwahrscheinlichkeit selbst beeinflussen. Der Anteil derer, die auf die Frage nach der Wahlintention mit „Weiß nicht“ antworten, liegt bei Anhängern mit gleichstarken Parteibindungen zwischen politischen Lagern knapp sieben Prozentpunkte signifikant über dem Anteil für Anhänger einer einzelnen Partei. Mehrfache Anhänger mit unterschiedlich starken Bindungen wählen in nahezu gleichem Maß wie Anhänger einer einzelnen Partei die (stärkere) Identifikationspartei, während der totale Effekt der Parteiidentifikation bei mehrfachen Anhängern mit konfligierenden Identifikationen und/oder gleichstarken Bindungen geringer ausfällt.},

  abstract = {This article outlines the various applications of longitudinal models using the structural equation modeling (SEM) framework. Two classical approaches of longitudinal analysis in SEM are the autoregressive cross-lagged models and the latent growth curve models. Hybrid longitudinal models in SEM attempt to combine the two strands of techniques. Recently, these hybrid models have been expanded upon to properly separate between- and within-effects. This article demonstrates the application of these models by empirically examining the relationship between environmental values and attitudes towards the so-called Energy Transition in Germany over time. We show that a variety of research questions can be examined using longitudinal models in SEM. The new developments in longitudinal models in SEM furthermore make it possible for researchers to more accurately test theories.},

  abstract = {Keeping respondents who are likely to drop out of a panel in the sample is a major task for panel data infrastructures. This is especially important when respondents at risk of dropping out are notably different to other respondents. Hence, it is key to identify those respondents and prevent them from dropping out. Response behavior in previous waves, e.g. response or nonresponse, has been shown to be a good predictor of next wave's response. Studying patterns of time-to-response and nonresponse over multiple panel waves can be a promising approach to identify participants with a high likelihood of leaving the panel.},

Emotional normalization occurs when audiences lose sensitivity to attacks, tempering emotional arousal.

I find that attitudes like trust in government, national identification and views of Islam remain unchanged. Sadness, fear and anger are heightened for up to three days after the attack.

In the present article, we conducted two studies examining the associations between meat consumption and personality traits, political attitudes, and environmental attitudes in two large German representative samples (Ntotal~=~8,879, aged 18–96 years). Cross-sectional data on frequency of meat consumption, socio-demographics, personality traits, and political and environmental attitudes were collected via self-reports. In both studies, male sex, younger age, and lower educational attainment were significantly positively related to meat consumption. In Study 1, results of the partial correlations and the hierarchical regression analysis controlling for socio-demographics showed that the personality traits of openness and agreeableness, as well as conservative political and social views, explained unique variance in meat consumption. In Study 2, partial correlations and hierarchical regression analyses showed that openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness were all uniquely negatively related to meat consumption. Moreover, these analyses documented that people scoring high in right-wing attitudes and low in pro-environmental attitudes reported more overall meat consumption. Taken together, these two studies provided evidence that socio-demographics, personality traits, and attitudes are indeed related to how much meat is consumed. Implications and future prospects for the study of individual differences in meat consumption are discussed.},

  abstract = {Die sogenannte Flüchtlingskrise ist eines der dominierenden Themen in Westeuropa und steht im Zusammenhang mit zunehmend erfolgreichen rechtspopulistischen Parteien und Bewegungen. Die deutsche Gesellschaft scheint gespalten zu sein in der Frage, ob die Aufnahme von Flüchtlingen für Deutschland mehr Chancen oder mehr Risiken mit sich bringt. Dieser Artikel analysiert die Frage nach den Gründen für eine optimistische bzw. pessimistische Sicht auf die Folgen der Flüchtlingsaufnahme. Anknüpfend an drei zentrale Erklärungsansätze der vergleichenden Forschung zu immigrationsbezogenen Einstellungen testen wir den Einfluss von sozioökonomischen Determinanten, kulturellen Determinanten (Ethnozentrismus und soziales Vertrauen) sowie von Kontakt mit Flüchtlingen. Datengrundlage bildet das GESIS-Panel 2016. Soziales Vertrauen, Ethnozentrismus und Kontakt erweisen sich als erklärungskräftige Determinanten. Insbesondere Ethnozentrismus hat einen starken Effekt auf die Einstellungen zu den Konsequenzen der Aufnahme von Flüchtlingen in Deutschland. Soziales Vertrauen wirkt offenbar weniger direkt, sondern eher indirekt, vermittelt über Ethnozentrismus.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Carefully designed probability-based sample surveys can be prohibitively expensive to conduct. As such, many survey organizations have shifted away from using expensive probability samples in favor of less expensive, but possibly less accurate, nonprobability web samples. However, their lower costs and abundant availability make them a potentially useful supplement to traditional probability-based samples. We examine this notion by proposing a method of supplementing small probability samples with nonprobability samples using Bayesian inference. We consider two semi-conjugate informative prior distributions for linear regression coefficients based on nonprobability samples, one accounting for the distance between maximum likelihood coefficients derived from parallel probability and non-probability samples, and the second depending on the variability and size of the nonprobability sample. The method is evaluated in comparison with a reference prior through simulations and a real-data application involving multiple probability and nonprobability surveys fielded simultaneously using the same questionnaire. We show that the method reduces the variance and mean-squared error (MSE) of coefficient estimates and model-based predictions relative to probability-only samples. Using actual and assumed cost data we also show that the method can yield substantial cost savings (up to 55\%) for a fixed MSE.},

Content of the instruments varied widely, from proximal measures (e.g., clinical symptoms, comorbidities, etc.) to distal measures such as political attitudes.

Mit Hilfe von Daten aus einer mehrwelligen Wiederholungsbefragung im Rahmen der German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES) wird gezeigt, dass sich das Muster der vorübergehenden Verstimmung des gesamten Elektorats nicht auf der individuellen Ebene wiederfindet. Bei der überwiegenden Mehrzahl der Befragten entwickeln sich die Urteile über die Regierungsarbeit und die Regierungsparteien zwischen 2014 und 2017 in komplexeren und voneinander abweichenden Mustern. In diesem Zeitraum verbesserten oder verschlechterten sich bei mehr als der Hälfte der Befragten die Urteile über die Regierung und die sie tragenden Parteien dauerhaft. Diese anhaltenden Veränderungen hängen deutlich mit Einstellungen zur Zuwanderungspolitik vor der Flüchtlingskrise zusammen. Der Tendenz nach kam es somit zu einer policy-orientierten Polarisierung der Partei- und Regierungsbewertungen.},

The first goal was to test the hypothesis that subjective ill-being is associated with Islamophobia. The second goal, contingent on the results of testing for the association between subjective ill-being and Islamophobia, was to test a set of variables presumed to moderate this relationship—positive and negative contact with Muslims, right-wing political views, political participation, the importance of political life, and cultural diversity orientation. Data from the GESIS Panel, a probability-based panel representative of the German-speaking population aged between 18 and 70 years permanently residing in Germany, were used to test the study hypotheses. The data provided support for the hypothesis that subjective ill-being is indeed associated with Islamophobia in Germany (r = .12, p {$<$} .01). The data provided support for only one of the moderator hypothesis, namely cultural diversity orientation. Specifically, the data showed that the relationship between subjective ill-being and Islamophobia is stronger for those who have low (rather than high) cultural diversity orientation.},

  abstract = {With climate change and its consequences believed to be among the most vital challenges for humanity and the Earth’s ecosystem, it is important to understand why individuals do or do not adopt proenvironmental attitudes and behaviors. Personality traits are well suited for this purpose. Because no recent work has systematically combined the accumulating evidence on this topic, we aimed to meta-analyze the associations of the Big Five and HEXACO personality domains with proenvironmental attitudes and behaviors. A meta-analysis of 38 sources ( N = 44,993) implicated openness and honesty-humility as the strongest correlates of proenvironmental attitudes ( r = .22 and .20) and behaviors ( r = .21 and .25). Agreeableness, conscientiousness, and, to a lesser extent, extraversion were also associated with proenvironmental attitudes ( r = .15, .12, and .09) and behaviors ( r = .10, .11, and .10). Heterogeneity among effect sizes was partly explained by samples’ gender ratio, age, and country of origin and by the personality model. P-curve analyses, funnel plots, and Egger’s tests indicated significant but sporadic and small publication bias. As a validity test, the meta-analytic associations collectively provided substantial predictive accuracy for proenvironmental attitudes ( r = .44–.45) and behaviors ( r = .28–.43) in independent holdout samples.},

  abstract = {Online panels – surveys administered over the Internet in which persons are asked to complete surveys regularly – offer cost reductions compared to surveys that use more traditional modes of data collection (face-to-face, telephone, and mail). However, some characteristics of online panels may cause errors, threatening the data quality. For example, excluding non-Internet users may result in coverage error; if persons selected for the study cannot be reached or do not want to participate, it may result in nonresponse error; study participants may choose to stop participating in later waves (attrition). Furthermore, respondents may learn to answer dishonestly or answer filter questions negatively to reduce the burden of participation. The main question of this dissertation is that of how good is the data collected in probability-based online panels (i.e., panels in which respondents are selected by researchers as a result of application of statistical procedures of random sampling). The five studies in this dissertation address the questions of data quality, using data from a probability-based telephone-recruited online panel of Internet users in Germany. To answer the question about goodness of the final estimates collected in the online panel, we compared data from the online panel to data from two high-quality face-to-face reference surveys. We found several differences among the surveys, however, most of these differences averaged to a few percentage points. We took the analysis further studying mode system effects (i.e., differences in the estimates as the results of the whole process by which they were collected). We found that the online panel and further two reference surveys differed in attitudinal measures. However, for factual questions the reference surveys differed from the online panel and not from each other. Our overall conclusion is that the data from the online panel is fairly comparable to the data from high-quality face-to-face surveys. This dissertation concentrated on the processes that can cause errors in data collected in the online panel. We found that participation in the panel is selective: previous experience with the Internet and online surveys predicted willingness to participate and actual participation in the panel. Incentives and fieldwork agencies that performed the recruitment also influenced the decision to participate. To study why panel members chose to discontinue participation, we contrasted the role of incentives and non-reward motivation. We found that respondents who viewed surveys as long, difficult, too personal were more likely to attrite and that incentives (although negatively related to attrition) did not compensate for this burdensome experience. To find out if the group of respondents who are longer in the panel would answer differently than the group of respondents with a shorter duration, we conducted two experiments. We found limited evidence of advantageous learning and no evidence of disadvantageous learning. The results of this dissertation provide additional insight into the processes that contribute to the quality of data produced by probability-based online panels. These results can guide researchers who plan to build online panels and might prove useful for existing panels that consider switching to the online mode.},

For probability-based online panels, high-quality surveys or government statistics can be used as references. If differences among the benchmark and the online panel estimates are found, these can have several causes. First, the question wordings can differ between the sources, which can lead to differences in measurement. Second, the reference and the online panel may not be comparable in terms of sample composition. Finally, since the reference estimates are usually collected face-to-face or by telephone, mode effects might be expected. In this article, we investigate mode system effects, an alternative to mode effects that does not focus solely on measurement differences between the modes, but also incorporates survey design features into the comparison. The data from a probability-based offline-recruited online panel is compared to the data from two face-to-face surveys with almost identical recruitment protocols. In the analysis, the distinction is made between factual and attitudinal questions. We report both effect sizes of the differences and significances. The results show that the online panel differs from face-to-face surveys in both attitudinal and factual measures. However, the reference surveys only differ in attitudinal measures and show no significant differences for factual questions. We attribute this to the instability of attitudes and thus show the importance of triangulation and using two surveys of the same mode for comparison.},

  abstract = {Abstract                        Background:             The current COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge of research activity. While this research provides important insights, the multitude of studies results in an increasing segmentation of information. To ensure comparability across projects and institutions, standard datasets are needed. Here, we introduce the “German Corona Consensus Dataset” (GECCO), a uniform dataset that uses international terminologies and health IT standards to improve interoperability of COVID-19 data.             Methods:             Based on previous work (e.g., the ISARIC-WHO COVID-19 case report form) and in coordination with experts from university hospitals, professional associations and research initiatives, data elements relevant for COVID-19 research were collected, prioritized and consolidated into a compact core dataset. The dataset was mapped to international terminologies, and the Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard was used to define interoperable, machine-readable data formats.             Results:             A core dataset consisting of 81 data elements with 281 response options was defined, including information about, for example, demography, anamnesis, symptoms, therapy, medications or laboratory values of COVID-19 patients. Data elements and response options were mapped to SNOMED CT, LOINC, UCUM, ICD-10-GM and ATC, and FHIR profiles for interoperable data exchange were defined.             Conclusion:             GECCO provides a compact, interoperable dataset that can help to make COVID-19 research data more comparable across studies and institutions. The dataset will be further refined in the future by adding domain-specific extension modules for more specialized use cases.},

  abstract = {. Machine learning tools are increasingly used in social sciences and policy fields due to their increase in predictive accuracy. However, little research has been done on how well the models of machine learning methods replicate across samples. We compare machine learning methods with regression on the replicability of variable selection, along with predictive accuracy, using an empirical dataset as well as simulated data with additive, interaction, and non-linear squared terms added as predictors. Methods analyzed include support vector machines (SVM), random forests (RF), multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS), and the regularized regression variants, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), and elastic net. In simulations with additive and linear interactions, machine learning methods performed similarly to regression in replicating predictors; they also performed mostly equal or below regression on measures of predictive accuracy. In simulations with square terms, machine learning methods SVM, RF, and MARS improved predictive accuracy and replicated predictors better than regression. Thus, in simulated datasets, the gap between machine learning methods and regression on predictive measures foreshadowed the gap in variable selection. In replications on the empirical dataset, however, improved prediction by machine learning methods was not accompanied by a visible improvement in replicability in variable selection. This disparity is explained by the overall explanatory power of the models. When predictors have small effects and noise predominates, improved global measures of prediction in a sample by machine learning methods may not lead to the robust selection of predictors; thus, in the presence of weak predictors and noise, regression remains a useful tool for model building and replication.},

Die Annahme eines einheitlichen Lebensstandards für alle in Deutschland lebenden Personen ist daher wenig wahrscheinlich. Da es jedoch in Deutschland laut Bundesverfassungsgericht ein Grundrecht auf Gewährleistung eines menschenwürdigen Existenzminimums gibt (1 BvL 1/09, 1 BvL 3/09, 1 BvL 4/09, Abs.1), ist es eine sozialpolitisch wichtige Frage, ob sich ein minimaler Lebensstandard definieren lässt, über den man notwendigerweise verfügen muss, um in Deutschland ein gerade noch ausreichendes Leben zu führen.},
